2022 has been arguably the best year for hip-hop since 2015. Multiple rappers dropped what I believe are their best albums yet. It was hard to narrow down my list but I managed to come up with my 10 favorites below. Honorable mentions go to Freddie Gibbs, Earl Sweatshirt, Pusha T, Earthgang, Tobi Lou, and Brockhampton.
